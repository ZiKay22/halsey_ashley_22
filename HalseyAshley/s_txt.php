Following its release, Hopeless Fountain Kingdom debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States and the Canadian Albums Chart. The album was also certified 2× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the US. In support of the album, Halsey embarked on the Hopeless Fountain Kingdom Tour (2017–2018).

As a result, Hopeless Fountain Kingdom is primarily a pop and R&B record and features synth-pop and electropop.

              <p class="card-text">If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power is the fourth studio album by American singer Halsey, released on August 27, 2021, by Capitol Records. It was written by Halsey, Johnathan Cunningham, Greg Kurstin, and its producers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails.Halsey described the project as "a concept album about the joys and horrors of pregnancy and childbirth".

                The cover artwork of If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power was inspired by artistic depictions of Mary, mother of Jesus. A theatrical film directed by American filmmaker Colin Tilley, titled after the album and featuring its music, screened in select IMAX cinemas around the world on August 25 and 26, 2021, leading up to the album release. If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power is an alternative rock, grunge-pop, pop punk, and rock record with heavy industrial influence, driven by clattering drums, distorted guitars, and a cinematic texture to its music. Its lyrics center on feminist themes, such as addressing patriarchy and institutionalized misogyny.

                        <li>   In the background, screaming, "Everybody, look at me"</li>

It was released on June 2, 2017, through Astralwerks. The album features guest appearances from Quavo, Lauren Jauregui and Cashmere Cat. Halsey co-wrote every song on the album, while production was handled by Lido and Benny Blanco, among others. Following its release, Hopeless Fountain Kingdom debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States and the Canadian Albums Chart. The album was also certified 2× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the US. In support of the album, Halsey embarked on the Hopeless Fountain Kingdom Tour (2017–2018). The album was described by Halsey as having more "radio friendly music" when compared to her previous releases. As a result, Hopeless Fountain Kingdom is primarily a pop and R&B record and features synth-pop and electropop.

It was written by Halsey, Johnathan Cunningham, Greg Kurstin, and its producers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails.Halsey described the project as "a concept album about the joys and horrors of pregnancy and childbirth".
                                                  
                                                                  The cover artwork of If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power was inspired by artistic depictions of Mary, mother of Jesus. A theatrical film directed by American filmmaker Colin Tilley, titled after the album and featuring its music, screened in select IMAX cinemas around the world on August 25 and 26, 2021, leading up to the album release. If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power is an alternative rock, grunge-pop, pop punk, and rock record with heavy industrial influence, driven by clattering drums, distorted guitars, and a cinematic texture to its music. Its lyrics center on feminist themes, such as addressing patriarchy and institutionalized misogyny.

It was released on August 28, 2015 through Astralwerks.Musically, Badlands is an electropop, dark pop, alternative pop, synth-pop, and pop record featuring industrial undertones. Halsey wrote every song on the album when she was 19, while production was handled by a number of producers. Norwegian producer Lido was one of the main producers on Badlands. The album was described by Halsey as lacking a "proper radio hit".

                                                                        The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States with first-week sales of 115,000 copies, 97,000 of that estimate being pure album sales.The album was eventually certified double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Badlands found success in many countries outside of the United States; it reached the top ten of the music charts of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland and the United Kingdom. It was also certified Gold in several countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The album was further promoted by Halsey's debut headlining world concert tour, the Badlands Tour (2015–2016).

      <p class="card-text fs-5">If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power is the fourth studio album by American singer Halsey, released on August 27, 2021, by Capitol Records. It was written by Halsey, Johnathan Cunningham, Greg Kurstin, and its producers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails.Halsey described the project as "a concept album about the joys and horrors of pregnancy and childbirth".

        The cover artwork of If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power was inspired by artistic depictions of Mary, mother of Jesus. A theatrical film directed by American filmmaker Colin Tilley, titled after the album and featuring its music, screened in select IMAX cinemas around the world on August 25 and 26, 2021, leading up to the album release. If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power is an alternative rock, grunge-pop, pop punk, and rock record with heavy industrial influence, driven by clattering drums, distorted guitars, and a cinematic texture to its music. Its lyrics center on feminist themes, such as addressing patriarchy and institutionalized misogyny.

      <p class="card-text ">If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power is the fourth studio album by American singer Halsey, released on August 27, 2021, by Capitol Records. It was written by Halsey, Johnathan Cunningham, Greg Kurstin, and its producers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails.Halsey described the project as "a concept album about the joys and horrors of pregnancy and childbirth".

        The cover artwork of If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power was inspired by artistic depictions of Mary, mother of Jesus. A theatrical film directed by American filmmaker Colin Tilley, titled after the album and featuring its music, screened in select IMAX cinemas around the world on August 25 and 26, 2021, leading up to the album release. If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power is an alternative rock, grunge-pop, pop punk, and rock record with heavy industrial influence, driven by clattering drums, distorted guitars, and a cinematic texture to its music. Its lyrics center on feminist themes, such as addressing patriarchy and institutionalized misogyny.

      <p class="card-text ">Described as the "candy-colored, R-rated new entry in the DC Extended Universe", Birds of Prey, the film honored a classic superhero movie tradition as seen with the Suicide Squad soundtrack for the 2016 film, Suicide Squad. The album features songs by various female artists, including Megan Thee Stallion, Halsey, Saweetie, Doja Cat, Normani, and Summer Walker. The director of the film, Cathy Yan, stated that music is a super important concept in film and that it "motivates [her]". She went on the say that "it kind of helps me create the characters". Yan and the production team worked closely with Atlantic Records to assemble a "sort of musical girl gang", and create an all-female soundtrack for this women-powered world.

        Kevin Weaver, president of the Atlantic Records West Coast of the soundtrack, went on to say he "was looking for a female, badass sensibility to tie directly back to Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey characters" and he "wanted to mirror Harley's journey with a music sensibility that kind of spoke to those same themes and through-lines"
        The genres of the album have been described by Crimson staff writer, Annie Harrigan, as hip hop, pop, alternative rock and rap. Songs like "Boss Bitch", "So Thick" and "Diamonds" include uplifting lyrics and embody themes like "self-sufficiency, hard work, and confidence". "Experiment on Me" has "heavy guitar, a steady beat, and screamo-style vocals", while "Danger" is "one of the more hardcore tracks", featuring "strong beats, echoey and screamo vocals, and strong hip-hop and rock influences".

      <p class="card-text fs-4">If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power is the fourth studio album by American singer Halsey, released on August 27, 2021, by Capitol Records. It was written by Halsey, Johnathan Cunningham, Greg Kurstin, and its producers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails.Halsey described the project as "a concept album about the joys and horrors of pregnancy and childbirth".

        The cover artwork of If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power was inspired by artistic depictions of Mary, mother of Jesus. A theatrical film directed by American filmmaker Colin Tilley, titled after the album and featuring its music, screened in select IMAX cinemas around the world on August 25 and 26, 2021, leading up to the album release. If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power is an alternative rock, grunge-pop, pop punk, and rock record with heavy industrial influence, driven by clattering drums, distorted guitars, and a cinematic texture to its music. Its lyrics center on feminist themes, such as addressing patriarchy and institutionalized misogyny.

      <p class="card-text fs-5">If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power is the fourth studio album by American singer Halsey, released on August 27, 2021, by Capitol Records. It was written by Halsey, Johnathan Cunningham, Greg Kurstin, and its producers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails.Halsey described the project as "a concept album about the joys and horrors of pregnancy and childbirth".

        The cover artwork of If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power was inspired by artistic depictions of Mary, mother of Jesus. A theatrical film directed by American filmmaker Colin Tilley, titled after the album and featuring its music, screened in select IMAX cinemas around the world on August 25 and 26, 2021, leading up to the album release. If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power is an alternative rock, grunge-pop, pop punk, and rock record with heavy industrial influence, driven by clattering drums, distorted guitars, and a cinematic texture to its music. Its lyrics center on feminist themes, such as addressing patriarchy and institutionalized misogyny.
